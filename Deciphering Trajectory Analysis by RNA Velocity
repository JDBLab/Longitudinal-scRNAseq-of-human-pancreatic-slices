Introduction
In order to understand cell trajectory analyses upon the treatment of BMP7, we utilized RNA velocity algorithms. We identified progenitor cells with the help of Seurat v4.0 (R package) and dissect cell fate changes at the single cell level in response to BMP-7 in a human pancreatic slices. 
This file contains a detailed procedure we followed to get the trajectory analysis.
The code which we used for the following procedure are adptated from the following tutorials- 
  i) scVelo infers gene-specific rates of transcription, splicing and degradation, and recovers the latent time of the underlying cellular processes. This latent time represents the cell’s internal clock and approximates the real time experienced by cells as they differentiate, based only on its transcriptional dynamics. Moreover, scVelo identifies regimes of regulatory changes such as stages of cell fate commitment and, therein, systematically detects putative driver genes.
   scVelo is developed by Bergen et al. (Nature Biotechnology, 2020). We followed documentation for the analysis- https://scvelo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/

  ii) In order to generate loom files, we utilized guide developed by Basil Khuder- https://github.com/basilkhuder/Seurat-to-RNA-Velocity
  iii) RNA velocity is analyzed by the Python package scVelo. We also followed tutorial given by Sam Morabito - https://smorabit.github.io/tutorials/8_velocyto/
  iv) PAGA (partition-based graph abstraction)- For mapping out the coarse-grained connectivity structures of complex manifolds (Genome Biology, 2019).
