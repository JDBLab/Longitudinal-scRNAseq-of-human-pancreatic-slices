In order to understand cell trajectory analyses upon the treatment of BMP7, we utilized RNA velocity algorithms. We identified progenitor cells with the help of Seurat v4.0 (R package designed for QC, analysis, and exploration of single-cell RNA-seq data. Seurat aims to enable users to identify and interpret sources of heterogeneity from single-cell transcriptomic measurements, and to integrate diverse types of single-cell data)  and tracked down
